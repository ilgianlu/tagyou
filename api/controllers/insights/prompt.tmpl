I have a device sending messages.
Data is collected as csv file, each line reports for every message:
1 the time of sending as timestamp
2 the identifier of device as senderid
3 the topic of message as topic
4 the content of message
{{ .Blueprint }}
Ignore "senderid" column.
Are this new sequence of messages possibly be generated by the same device?
give me the chance for every message.
the new sequence is:
{{ .DebugData }}
