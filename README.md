## presentation

yet another mqtt broker.

This is a personal project started to learn go language and empower my understanding of mqtt protocol in IOT environment.

Development is driven by :
* mqtt 5 specifications by OASIS
  https://mqtt.org/mqtt-specification/ 

* pure golang implementation

* http apis to configure and inspect behaviour

* ready for kubernetes deployment, prometheus friendly metrics exposed

* futuristic support for controlling security and control through machine learning

## build locally
there is a very simple Makefile in the project root.

* make build : install dependencies and build the project
* make clean : remove any user/build data
* make init : remove any user data to start with an empty db and new admin password

## first start
http apis are always authenticated, unlike the mqtt clients. First user to be created is "admin".
To set your password for "admin", at first launch, pass INIT_ADMIN_PASSWORD as env var so a user with username "admin" is created with selected password and you can start use apis (to create more users? register clients ?). All users can access everything.

```
docker run -e INIT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=my_fantastic_secure_password -e INIT_DB=true ilgianlu/tagyou
```

## apis

### auth and calling

to authenticate and get an api token :

```
curl -v http://localhost:8080/auth -d '{"Username":"admin","InputPassword":"my_fantastic_secure_password"}'
```

response :

```
{"token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiO....."}
```

Use Authorization header in api calls

```
curl -H "Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQ......" http://localhost:8080/clients
```

### available resources
* POST /auth
* GET /clients
* GET /clients/{id}
* POST /clients
* DELETE /clients/{id}
* GET /sessions
* GET /subscriptions
* GET /users
* POST /users
* DELETE /users/{id}

## deploy

The project is NOT READY for production deployment.
Can be tested quite easily pulling from docker hub

> docker pull ilgianlu/tagyou

Tag "latest" is continuously refresh by github actions built on main branch.

## contribution

I'm developing on linux, visual studio code, go lang 1.23.

Build and modify should not more difficult than cloning the repo, branching, opening a pull request. Please open an issue before contributing and feel free to include @ilgianlu
for the review.
